# YouLoader-GUI-App

This is a Python based GUI Application where user can download requested video in MP4 format. 
Uses Googlesearch and YouTube API's for extracting urls and downloading video. The downloaded video can also be played with a integrated VLC module.

Used OpenCV so that the app opens only when it detects a user face.
